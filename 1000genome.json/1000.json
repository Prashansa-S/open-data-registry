    "Description": "The 1000 Genomes Project is an international collaboration which has established the most detailed catalogue of human genetic variation, including SNPs, structural variants, and their haplotype context. There were a total of 3202 individuals sequenced as part of Phase 3 of this project. The high coverage samples were processed using the Illumina DRAGEN v3.5.7b pipeline and are available at s3://1000genomes-dragen/. This dataset contains the VCFs transformed to Parquet/ORC in 3 different schemas - partitioned by samples, partitioned by chromosome and a nested data format. These representations of the 1000 Genomes DRAGEN data are stored in Parquet/ORC format and can be queried through [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc). To add these tables to your Glue Data Catalog and for sample queries on this dataset, please refer to the link in our Documentation.",
